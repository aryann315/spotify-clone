About: A Clone website made for famous music player app Spotify.

Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Features: Play/Pause a song by it. Adjust the volume for the currently playing song using the volume slider. Showcases the poster, song name and artist name for the currently playing song in bottom left player menu. Can also add a song to the favourites list (denoted by filled green heart) and also remove it (denoted by empty grey outlined heart). Can skip the song to next or previous in the queue or jump to different parts in a song using the song progress slider. Only showcases upto 50 songs (locally downloaded) with their posters, name and artist name as no API was used to fetch the songs. Dummy buttons on the left navbar menu and a dummy dropdown menu with user details also included (just for the sake of clone). 

The project was solely done in order to learn to implement and practice medium to hard level JavaScript.
